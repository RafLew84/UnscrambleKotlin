# UnscrambleKotlin

App Developed as a learning tool

**Unscramble** is a fun and interactive word game app. Players are presented with scrambled words and must rearrange the letters to form meaningful words.The application was created using Jetpack Compose. Unscramble utilizes `DataStore` to save and retrieve the game state. The application was implemented following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern, using a repository. 
StateFlow was used for managing the application state and reactivity, allowing easy real-time view updates in response to changes in the game state.

The application is based on the official [Android Codelab](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-training-viewmodel#0).
